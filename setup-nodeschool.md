# Nodeschool setup

## install Node

### install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager)
this is the best tool to manage your Node setup as it allows you to change from one Node version to another very easily
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.29.0/install.sh | bash
```

### install the latest version of Node with NVM
```
nvm install 4.2
```
now `which node` should return something like `/home/myusername/.nvm/v4.2.1/bin/node`
